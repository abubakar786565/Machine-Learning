    "| **Overfitting** | When a model learns **too much from the training data**, including noise and outliers. It performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data. |\n",
    "| **Underfitting** | When a model is **too simple** to learn the underlying patterns of the data. It performs poorly on both training and test data. |\n",
